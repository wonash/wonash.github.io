## My skills 

> Section is work in progress! 

I found LaTeX incredibly helpful for my math and physics courses to take notes or write lab reports. I find myself using it outside of coursework, when writing or organizing information. I do recognize the importance of handwritten notes, and solve problems by hand.  

I have experience in Web Development. I personally enjoy simple and straightforward webpages, which may show from this website and my [startpage](https://github.com/wonash/startpage). 

I am familiar with the command line interface, in particular, zsh. I would like to get learn more about shell scripting. 

I am learning C programming, and have experience using Vim and Neovim. I use the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) setup.

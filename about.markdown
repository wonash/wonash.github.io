## About Me 

Good to see you here. 

I am Ashley Won, or, 원수연 (Won Sueyeon) depending on what language you want to use to refer me by. 

I was born and raised in **Bloomington, Indiana**, but I have family in **Seoul, South Korea** and spent a considerable time there. Currently, I am studying computer science at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, at Indiana University Bloomington.

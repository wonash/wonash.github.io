## About Me 

> Section is work in progress! 

Good to see you here. 

I am Ashley Won, or, 원수연 (Won Sueyeon) depending on what language you want to refer me by. 

I was born and raised in Bloomington, Indiana, but I have family in Seoul, South Korea and spent a considerable time there. Currently, I am studying computer science at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, at Indiana University Bloomington. 

In my free time, I enjoy working on my personal projects, writing stories, drawing, taking care of my houseplants, and playing video games.

## About Me 

Good to see you here. 

I am Ashley Won, or, 원수연 (Won Sueyeon) depending on what language you want to use to refer to me. 

I was born and raised in **Bloomington, Indiana**, but I have family in **Seoul, South Korea** and spent a considerable time there. Currently, I am studying computer science at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, at Indiana University Bloomington. 

### A little history  

I've been writing and drawing since I could remember. My mom has always provided me with writing and drawing materials, and helped me create little booklets with my writings on it. I regularly create short comic strips about my personal life or whatever I am interested in at the moment (I wrote few Polandball comics in the past). Writing and drawing has always been part of my life, and something I involve myself with daily. 

I've been interested in meteorology (more broadly, atmospheric science) since early 2018. I don't have a specific incident that got me interested in it. I started off being interested in historic and/or unique tropical cyclones. In particular, tropical cyclones with a [unique locations of formation](https://www.weather.gov/dtx/dtxcane) *, or have an [interesting history](https://www.weather.gov/hgx/projects_1943surprisehurricane) behind them. Which evolved into being interested in meteorology in general. 

I've played video games since I was young which gave me familiarity with computers and software. I wrote some elementary programs with scratch and c at home with my dad and school before university. I am planning on getting more involved with game development. 

I am currently playing games in Touhou Project (cool music, cool characters), and [few](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) [platformer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) games, although I do not have much time to play them these days due to university.  

 \* *The cyclone dubbed "Hurricane Huron" is not officially a hurricane by definition, but it is unofficially referred as such due to bearing many of its characteristics. Regardless, very interesting phenomena.*
